            <h1>Express Yourself</h1>
            <p>Horizons is a celebration of the incredible intersection between art and technology.  It is a platform for people to express themselves through art while using technology or engineering to augment its impact.</p>
            <p>Moreso, art and technology come together as avenues for people to share their ideas. To share their findings. To share their feelings. To express themselves.</p>
            <p>At Horizons, we challenge you to do just that!</p>
