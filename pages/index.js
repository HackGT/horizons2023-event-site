                    Horizons is a celebration of the incredible intersection between art and
                    technology. It is a platform for people to express themselves through
                    art while using technology or engineering to augment its impact.

                    Moreso, art and technology come together as¬†avenues for people to share
                    their ideas. To share their findings. To share their feelings. To
                    express themselves.
