                Horizons is a celebration of the incredible intersection between
                art and technology. It is a platform for people to express
                themselves through art while using technology or engineering to
                augment its impact.
              </p>
              <p>
                Moreso, art and technology come together as avenues for people
                to share their ideas. To share their findings. To share their
                feelings. To express themselves.
              </p>
              <p>At Horizons, we challenge you to do just that!</p>
