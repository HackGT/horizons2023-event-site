                <h1>Express Yourself</h1>
                <p>
                    Horizons is a celebration of the incredible intersection between art and
                    technology. It is a platform for people to express themselves through
                    art while using technology or engineering to augment its impact.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moreso, art and technology come together as¬†avenues for people to share
                    their ideas. To share their findings. To share their feelings. To
                    express themselves.
                </p>
                <p>At Horizons, we challenge you to do just that!</p>
